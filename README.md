Audyssey .ady file editor

Preview/early alpha release, for testing functionality of the parameter editing.

Please note that this program is highly unfinished.

Exit with the normal Windows 'X' in the corner of the window.

Mind that 'save' instead of 'save as' will overwrite your file!

You can then upload the new file to your receiver for testing.
